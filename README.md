# brightwired 
BrightWired is a sensory-friendly productivity and learning toolkit designed to reduce cognitive overload. It combines an adaptive text summarizer, low-stress planning tools, and a motivation assistant to help students start and sustain focused work. The project was built with neurodivergent learners in mind, including students with ADHD, dyslexia, and general concentration challenges.

## why 
Many productivity and learning tools focus on sustained attention, quick reading, and frequent context-switching. For students with ADHD, dyslexia, or executive dysfunction, these ideas can make even simple tasks seem overwhelming. Instead of easing the process, current tools often add to the stress by fragmenting workflow across multiple platforms, complicated interfaces, and strict productivity systems. Most standard tools also assume linear thinking patterns, which can further disadvantage neurodivergent learners. 

## gaps in existing tools 
- Prioritizes aesthetics over functional cognitive accessibility 
- Assumes consistent motivation, focus, and energy levels 
- Fragments workflows across multiple tabs and applications 
- Overly cluttered interfaces that increase sensory and cognitive load 
- Summarization tools that enforce a single tone or style rather than adapting to speciifc student needs 
BrightWired aims to bridge these gaps by priortising a utility first, minimalist UI, non fragemented workflow, and features designed specifically for cognitive accessiblity and task initiation.
